## Composition vs inheritance

This exercises is to practice composition over inheritance. This one has been done in Java ☕️.

Exercise is based on this [kata](https://github.com/Codesai/practice_program/tree/master/katas_java/05-refactoring-awful-inheritance-use-with-beverage-prices-kata).

- There is a '_wrong_' directory where code is inherited (default kata code) ❌ 
- There is a '_correct_' directory where code uses composition over inheritance ✅

In this case, there are some tests too with JUnit 🧪.
